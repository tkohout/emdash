# MCP

## Main Files

- `src/main/core/mcp/services/McpService.ts`
- `src/main/core/mcp/utils/` — adapters, catalog, config IO, config paths, conversion
- `src/main/core/mcp/controller.ts`
- `src/core/primitives/mcp/api/`
- `src/core/features/mcp/browser/` (`mcp-view.tsx`, `components/`)

## Current Behavior

- MCP server configs are read, adapted, merged, and written across supported agent ecosystems
- provider-specific config formats are handled through adapters in `src/main/core/mcp/utils/`
- the renderer MCP UI manages installed servers and catalog entries
- Chat's MCP list reports configured servers, not inferred connection health. Codex's recognized
  synthetic startup failures are translated by its ACP enrichment hook and displayed on the
  composer MCP trigger/popover instead of opening a transcript turn. Startup errors are scoped to
  the current Session activation and are not retained as configuration. Other provider diagnostics
  and ordinary failed MCP tool invocations remain unchanged; there is no health polling.

## Rules

- do not assume all providers support the same MCP transport types
- keep canonical MCP data in shared types and adapt at the edges
- if you add provider-specific MCP behavior, update both service and UI compatibility handling
